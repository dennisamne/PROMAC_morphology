## General results and the target genes

The analysis revealed 165 genes more abundant in the TN-treatment, and 178 more abundant in the C-treatment (@tbl-overview). As you soon will see, the amount of genes in the target gene list were so few, that they were included in the large scale analysis instead, but are still presented here for you to see. The section summarising the expression results is the section called "The rest of the DE-genes".

```{r}
#| label: tbl-overview

Among the target-gene list, only 2 genes were statistically upregulated in the TN-treatment (@tbl-Up). Thus from here we employ a different approach to identify patterns connected to morphology, summarising the overall patterns seen using the KO-terms. But first we inspect the downregulated genes below.

```{r}
#| label: tbl-Up
#| tbl-cap: "Target genes among the TN-abundant genes, and their classification."
#| warning: false

#Upload the target gene lists into kegg and get annotation that way.
#Identifying target genes in the positive DE-expressed genes
kable(edgeR_KO %>%
  filter(type == "Up") %>%
  inner_join(koUpLegend %>% separate_rows(gene, sep = ","), by = "KEGG_ko") %>% # Removing several gene-namesin one row
  inner_join(target_genes, by = "gene")
 ) %>%
   kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover"))
```

The genes abundant in the C-treatment included 6 genes from the target gene list (@tbl-Down). Three of these were osmoregulatory genes involed in betaine/proline transport, and a membrane porin.

```{r}
#| label: tbl-Down
#| tbl-cap: "Target genes among the C-abundant genes, and their classification."
#| warning: false

#Identifying target genes in the negative DE-expressed genes
 kable(edgeR_KO %>%

  inner_join(target_genes, by = "gene")

```

What matches our data? Well the adherence proteins I think reflects a bit what we see. **Especially the adherence proteins together with the biofilm-formation genes may explain the aggregation patterns observed in the microscopy.** An interesting note is the occurence of 5 phage genes in conjunction with two defense genes, suggesting that phage infection and defense is on-going in the TN-treatment as opposed to the C-treatment.\
\
The appearance of the flaggellin and curli-genes are in opposition to what we see in the microscopy, there are more structures of filaments in the C-treatment, however these genes appear upregulated in the TN-treatment, it might be that these genes are used in the cell-cell connections in some way, rather than moving around, but it needs confirmation that pili-genes can be involved in this rather than mobility alone.

### The C-abundant genes

one morphology gene upregulated in the C-treatment [*flgE*](https://www.kegg.jp/entry/K02390)

Genes related to proline-metabolism, known to be important for osmoregulation were upregulated in the C-treatment

[*EIF5*](https://www.kegg.jp/entry/K03262) 🔵\

Thus we see several ribosome and translation genes statistically more abundant in the C-treatment. The pro-genes and porin are worth mentioning, but do not deserve more than a sentence as there are not so many genes involved in this pathway, perhaps if they have a large transcription in the C-treatment this will give validity.

## Summary

To recapitulate, morphological charateristics that were over-represented in the TN-treatment included Outer membrane blebbing and release of outer membrane vesicles, this was also true for the combination of connections between cells and blebbing (@fig-morphologies). The genes supporting what we see then includes the biofilm and adhesion genes that might help explain the bactteriall aggregation seen, there are allso three genes involved in LPS biosynthesis and exocytosis, which might explain the outer membrane vesicles seen in the TN-treatment. A sidenote is the presence of phage-genes being expressed, suggesting a top-down pressure by phages in the TN-treatment, and bacterial defense systems responding to this.\

Genes and systems supporting the occurrence of OMV's in the TN-treatment include :

The LPS and OMV's categories

Quorom-sensing and chemotaxis

The maintenance related activties in the C-treatment does not really get a large support, but three genes related to osmoregulation show up, and several ribosomal proteins pop-up, potentially reflecting cold adaptation.

To see large-scale patterns, the [COG-categories](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/research/cog#) were plotted to understand responses better (@fig-cogCats), the B-panel shoes the taxonomic contribution of all the statistically differentially abundant genes. The tpm values were average across samples and fraction to identify taxonomic fidelity of the functional categories. The taxonomic contribution overall showed a lot of taxa annotated only as bacteria, and a stronger presence of Archaea in the C-Treatment-enriched genes. The categories which show responses in the C-treatment are:\
Translation, ribosomal structure and biogenesis\
Energy production and conversion\
RNA processing and modification\
